    "section": "2 Project Descriptions",
    "text": "2 Project Descriptions\n\n2.1 Dr F. Murphy: ‘Humanising’ cell culture conditions for in vitro hazard assessment of nanomaterials\nKeywords: nanotoxicology, in vitro alternative, sustainable cell culture\n\n2.1.1 Brief overview\nThis project will involve assessing the impact of replacing animal-derived products (e.g. FBS) with human alternatives in the culture of lung cells to promote more ethical and sustainable toxicity testing of nanomaterials. Cell growth rates, differentiation state and sensitivity to pro-inflammatory agents and exposure to nanomaterials will be compared between cells cultured in media containing common animal-derived supplements or human-derived/synthetic alternatives.\n\n\n2.1.2 Background\nThe vast array of nanomaterials (NMs) under development raises ethical concerns over the reliance and extent of animal usage in the hazard assessment of substances. Burden et al. (2017) promoted consideration of the 3Rs (reduce, refine, replace) concept as a framework when developing strategies in nanosafety assessment (Burden et al. 2017). This approach requires the use of New Approach Methods (NAM) and novel in vitro models to generate the appropriate toxicity data for the hazard assessment of new materials.\nMany of the methods in current use are reliant on the use of animal-derived materials and reagents, in particular cell-based assays which grow cells in media supplemented with animal serum and the use of monoclonal animals raised in rodents and rabbits. The information gathered by in vitro testing therefore cannot be considered animal-free unless adaptions are made to standard in vitro protocols to replace all animal-derived reagents.\nFoetal bovine serum (FBS) is used by default as an additive for cell, organ and tissue culture media in biomedical research and testing to enhance cell growth and proliferation. Serum serves as a source of amino acids, proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, hormones, growth factors, inorganic salts, trace elements, and other compounds. It also improves the pH-buffering capacity of the medium and helps to reduce shear stress (i.e., physical damage that is caused by pipette manipulation and stirring). However, the production is unregulated and often associated with ethically and legally questionable practices and animal suffering (van der Valk et al. 2004).\nFurthermore using FBS in cell culture presents a number of significant scientific challenges; the exact composition of FBS is unknown, there is a risk of contamination with pathogens, and reproducibility of scientific experiments suffers from inconsistencies between FBS batches (Liu et al. 2023). Omitting ill-defined animal-derived ingredients like FBS is recommended in the Guidance Document on Good In Vitro Method Practices (GIVIMP), a key tool for ensuring reproducible study data generation (OECD 2018).\nHuman platelets contain abundant cytokines and growth factors offering the potential to replace FBS as universal growth supplement for cell culture (Burden et al. 2017).\n\n\n2.1.3 Objectives:\n\nAssess the impact of replacing FBS in human immune cell lines, THP-1 with HPL.\n\n\n\nDetermine growth rate during cell-line maintenance.\nAssess impact on differentiation from monocyte to macrophage phenotype.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to challenge the status quo methods used as standard in labs, often without consideration of the scientific or ethical implications. Therefore, a strategy to disseminate study aims and results will be developed utilising social media platforms and generation of explainer videos targeted at academics, students and the general public to promote the need to replace animal-derived products in scientific studies.\n\nThis project will therefore build the student’s scientific skills in experimental design, lab techniques, analysis of data and dissemination of results.\n\n\n\n2.2 Dr K. Neves: Peripheral vascular effects of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and obesity.\nKeywords: vascular biology, obesity, pulmonary hypertension\n\n2.2.1 Brief overview\nOur aim is to investigate peripheral vascular effects of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and obesity. To do that, aorta and mesenteric arteries isolated from rats exposed to hypoxia (PAH animal model) and treated for 10 weeks with chow or high fat diet will be investigated. Histological visualization and remodelling of aorta and mesenteric arteries will be assessed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Fibrosis and arterial stiffness will be assessed by picrosirius red and elastin staining, respectively."

    "text": "2 Will I be paid?\nInternships may be paid, unpaid, or partially-paid (e.g. the student may receive a stipend for the period, rather than an hourly rate).\nThe SIPBS matching scheme provides no funds either for the student, or in support of the project. Supervisors who offer projects may have financial resources that could be used to fund the project or pay the intern. Alternatively the student or the supervisor (or both together, depending on the scheme) may apply for funding from a third party, such as the university, a charity, or professional society, to support the placement."

    "text": "3 What will I get from the experience?\nBy engaging in a practical research project, you will obtain skills, knowledge, and experience that cannot be obtained in other ways. You will be able to establish professional connections and begin to network in the field, as well as contributing to finding answers to real, cutting-edge research questions.\nIf you think you might be interested in a research career, then a placement is one way to find out if that career path is something you might like.\nWhere placements, or their funding, are competitive, there may be an element of prestige to winning that funding which helps make your future CV stand out against other applicants’."

    "text": "5 Do I have to use the SIPBS matching scheme?\nNo. You are always free to obtain an internship independently of the SIPBS scheme.\nWe offer the scheme to simplify the process of matching interested students with supervisors who are thinking of offering projects. As there are usually fewer projects on offer than interested students, we need to manage this process. But if you are interested in working in a particular area, or with a particular group, there is no reason you should not approach potential supervisors directly, outwith this scheme."
