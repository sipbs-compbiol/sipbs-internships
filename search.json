    "text": "1 What is an internship?\nAn internship is a period of professional work experience. In the case of the SIPBS matching scheme, this is typically an 8-10 week summer placement in a working research laboratory within the department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Careers Service has support to help with finding a placement/internship outwith the SIPBS matching scheme.\n\nCareers Service Internship and Placement Advice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is very important for you to take responsibility for your own internship search.\nAs the Careers Service advises,\n\n“Source your own internship & placement: It’s very important to be proactive in your job search. Do not wait for vacancies to be advertised - it might never happen. Many organisations do not need to advertise their work experience opportunities, as they receive hundreds of speculative applications from students.”\n\nIf you wait to be noticed by someone and offered an internship, you will most likely not get one."

Supervisors who offer projects may have financial resources that could be used to fund the project or pay the intern. Alternatively the student or the supervisor (or both together, depending on the scheme) may apply for funding from a third party, such as the university, a charity, or professional society, to support the placement."

You will be able to establish professional connections and begin to network in the field, as well as contributing to finding answers to real, cutting-edge research questions.\nIf you think you might be interested in a research career, then a placement is one way to find out if that career path is something you might like.\nWhere placements, or their funding, are competitive, there may be an element of prestige to winning that funding which helps make your future CV stand out against other applicants’."

    "text": "2 Project Descriptions\n\n2.1 Dr F. Murphy: ‘Humanising’ cell culture conditions for in vitro hazard assessment of nanomaterials\nKeywords: nanotoxicology, in vitro alternative, sustainable cell culture\n\n2.1.1 Brief overview\nThis project will involve assessing the impact of replacing animal-derived products (e.g. FBS) with human alternatives in the culture of lung cells to promote more ethical and sustainable toxicity testing of nanomaterials. Cell growth rates, differentiation state and sensitivity to pro-inflammatory agents and exposure to nanomaterials will be compared between cells cultured in media containing common animal-derived supplements or human-derived/synthetic alternatives.\n\n\n2.1.2 Background\nThe vast array of nanomaterials (NMs) under development raises ethical concerns over the reliance and extent of animal usage in the hazard assessment of substances. Burden et al. (2017) promoted consideration of the 3Rs (reduce, refine, replace) concept as a framework when developing strategies in nanosafety assessment (Burden et al. 2017). This approach requires the use of New Approach Methods (NAM) and novel in vitro models to generate the appropriate toxicity data for the hazard assessment of new materials.\nMany of the methods in current use are reliant on the use of animal-derived materials and reagents, in particular cell-based assays which grow cells in media supplemented with animal serum and the use of monoclonal animals raised in rodents and rabbits. The information gathered by in vitro testing therefore cannot be considered animal-free unless adaptions are made to standard in vitro protocols to replace all animal-derived reagents.\nFoetal bovine serum (FBS) is used by default as an additive for cell, organ and tissue culture media in biomedical research and testing to enhance cell growth and proliferation. Serum serves as a source of amino acids, proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, lipids, hormones, growth factors, inorganic salts, trace elements, and other compounds. It also improves the pH-buffering capacity of the medium and helps to reduce shear stress (i.e., physical damage that is caused by pipette manipulation and stirring). However, the production is unregulated and often associated with ethically and legally questionable practices and animal suffering (van der Valk et al. 2004).\nFurthermore using FBS in cell culture presents a number of significant scientific challenges; the exact composition of FBS is unknown, there is a risk of contamination with pathogens, and reproducibility of scientific experiments suffers from inconsistencies between FBS batches (Liu et al. 2023). Omitting ill-defined animal-derived ingredients like FBS is recommended in the Guidance Document on Good In Vitro Method Practices (GIVIMP), a key tool for ensuring reproducible study data generation (OECD 2018).\nHuman platelets contain abundant cytokines and growth factors offering the potential to replace FBS as universal growth supplement for cell culture (Burden et al. 2017).\n\n\n2.1.3 Objectives:\n\nAssess the impact of replacing FBS in human immune cell lines, THP-1 with HPL.\n\n\n\nDetermine growth rate during cell-line maintenance.\nAssess impact on differentiation from monocyte to macrophage phenotype.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to challenge the status quo methods used as standard in labs, often without consideration of the scientific or ethical implications. Therefore, a strategy to disseminate study aims and results will be developed utilising social media platforms and generation of explainer videos targeted at academics, students and the general public to promote the need to replace animal-derived products in scientific studies.\n\nThis project will therefore build the student’s scientific skills in experimental design, lab techniques, analysis of data and dissemination of results.\n\n\n\n2.2 Dr K. Neves: Peripheral vascular effects of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and obesity.\nKeywords: vascular biology, obesity, pulmonary hypertension\n\n2.2.1 Brief overview\nOur aim is to investigate peripheral vascular effects of pulmonary hypertension (PAH) and obesity. To do that, aorta and mesenteric arteries isolated from rats exposed to hypoxia (PAH animal model) and treated for 10 weeks with chow or high fat diet will be investigated. Histological visualization and remodelling of aorta and mesenteric arteries will be assessed by haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Fibrosis and arterial stiffness will be assessed by picrosirius red and elastin staining, respectively.\n\n\n\n2.3 Dr N. Weir: Professionalism, professional identity, and community pharmacy culture: the context of substance dependency\n\n2.3.1 Project Team\nNatalie Weir, Emma Dunlop, Andrew Radley, Adrian MacKenzie\n\n\n2.3.2 Project outline\nNew Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) standards, alongside increasing acknowledgment of the importance of Trauma Informed Care (TIC) (Chisholm-Burns and Spivey 2023), will assist community pharmacy to better support people with substance dependency. Little is known about the culture and professionalism that exists within community pharmacy staff in Scotland relating to their role with people with substance dependency, although research indicates the pharmacy setting can be a stigmatising environment which may contribute to health inequalities (Radley et al. 2017). Professional identity, and how it relates to the provision of patient-centred care, is an important consideration for the role of pharmacists whilst the scope of practice is expanding. Students, foundation pharmacists, and newly qualified community pharmacists will be forming their professional identify and can offer unique perspective on the culture and professionalism within this context.\n\n\n2.3.3 Project aim\nTo explore the perceptions of the professionalism within community pharmacy culture, in the context of people with substance dependency, through the lens of student and newly qualified pharmacists.\n\n\n2.3.4 Methods\nThe internship will follow on from work undertaken by six final year pharmacy students from Sept 2023 until Feb 2024, which will involve exploration of Professionalism (as a factor of how people ‘act’ and ‘think’) and Professional Identity (how they ‘feel’) (Chadha, Charrois, and Hall 2022). The internship may involve reviewing literature, undertaking thematic analysis of interview data, writing reports / publications, developing visual research outputs, and/or performing research interviews. You will have close supervision and support throughout.\n\n\n2.3.5 Output\nThe findings will offer insight into the existing professionalism and culture within Scottish community pharmacies and the extent to which the MAT standards and TIC principles are currently embedded in practice. Furthermore, the findings will indicate how early experiences in community pharmacy practice influence professional identity with scope to develop training interventions. The results will inform the development of a UK-wide questionnaire with larger cohorts to aid in the exploration and implementation of MAT and TIC principles."

    "text": "2 Project Descriptions\n\n2.1 Dr F. Murphy: Evaluating the impact of removing animal-derived products from cell culture protocols\nKeywords: 3Rs, nanotoxicology, in vitro alternative, sustainable cell culture\n\n2.1.1 Brief overview\nThe growth of cells is reliant on nutrient rich growth media which is commonly supplemented with products extracted from animal sources. The ethical concerns over the extraction methods used to generate animal-derived products have prompted a drive to replacement in standard lab assays where possible. To support switching to more sustainable and ethical human-derived proteins in cell culture, we first need to understand how this switch may affect how our cells grow and behave under different conditions. This project will compare the effect of switching to alternative human or synthetic proteins to promote the adoption of animal-free alternatives in the culture of lung epithelial cell and immune cells. This project will compare the effect of switching to alternative human or synthetic proteins to promote the adoption of animal-free alternatives in the culture of lung epithelial cell and immune cells.\n\n\n\n2.2 Dr F. Murphy: Evaluating the utility of Galleria Mellonella to assess the toxicity of carbon nanotubes\nKeywords: 3Rs, nanotoxicology, in vitro alternative, sustainable cell culture\n\n2.2.1 Brief overview\nThe growing nanotechnology sector based on the development of nanomaterials, 1000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, has caused concerns over the impact new forms of particles may have on human lungs. The methods we currently use to identify potentially toxic particles rely heavily on substituting humans with rodents in experiments designed to simulate real-life exposure to dusts. However, as well as being expensive and time consuming this approach is considered unsustainable and ethically questionable. We urgently need new methods to investigate the potential toxic effects of nanomaterials. The larvae of Galleria Mellonella are increasingly being used as an infection model to study virulence factors and pathogenesis of many prominent human pathogens. The immune system of G. mellonella larvae shares a high degree of structural and functional homology to the innate immune systems of vertebrates and possess blood cells (haemocytes) conside_red comparable to a number of human immune cells. This model has not yet been widely utilised for the hazard assessment of nanomaterials. This project aims to evaluate the utility of G. Mellonella to assess the toxicity of carbon nanotubes (CNT).\n\n\n\n2.3 Dr N. Rattray, Prof. A. Mullen: Exploring the Use of Fungal Microsome Systems as an Alternative to Animal Drug Metabolism Studies: a 3Rs Approach\nKeywords: 3Rs, pharmacodynamics, liver metabolism\n\n2.3.1 Brief overview\nThe accurate prediction of drug metabolism is a crucial aspect of drug development, but current methods often rely on the use of CYP450 microsomes from animals to model liver conversion of drugs and other xenobiotics. Aside from the use of animal extracts in these systems, they are also expensive, complex, and challenging to scale for high-throughput studies. As an alternative, fungal microsome systems, particularly those using Cunninghamella elegans to express many CYP450 enzymes that belong to the same superfamily of proteins found in humans, provide a cost-effective and efficient solution.\n\n\n2.3.2 Objectives\nThis project aims to evaluate and optimize fungal microsome systems as a reliable tool for drug metabolism studies. Specifically, it will:\n\nDevelop fungal systems expressing key human CYP450 isoforms involved in drug metabolism.\nCompare the performance of fungal microsomes with traditional murine liver microsomes in drug screening.\nInvestigate their scalability and reproducibility for high-throughput drug metabolism assessments.\nCan the fungal systems predict classic drug-drug interactions?\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Dr Z. Rattray: Developing new analytical methods for nanotechnology based products\nKeywords: Nanotechnology; Analysis; Bioanalysis; Antibody; Antibody-drug conjugates; peptides\n\n2.4.1 Brief Overview\nSIPBS is host to the EPSRC multiscale metrology suite for next generation health nanotechnologies national facility. The role of the facility is to develop new analytical methods so that we can develop new and safer medicines for unmet clinical need. In this project, you will be working with the Rattray lab to address a challenge in the analysis of nanotechnology based formulations."
