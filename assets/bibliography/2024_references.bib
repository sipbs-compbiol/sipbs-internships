abstract = {Due to the plethora of nanomaterials being manufactured, it is crucial that their effects on human health are understood. It is not feasible to assess the safety of all nanomaterials using animal-based toxicity tests. There are also scientific, business, legislative and ethical drivers to reconsider the use of such toxicity tests. Utilising non-traditional methods has the potential to improve the human relevance of nanosafety assessment, reduce the numbers of animals that are used, and shift the paradigm to a ‘21st century’ approach that exploits recent scientific and technological advances. This article considers how application of the 3Rs principles can be used as a framework to support and guide this paradigm shift in the short, medium and long-term. Bringing the community together to facilitate the transition is necessary to ensure that tangible impacts are made on the efficiency and robustness of the nanosafety assessment process.}

abstract = {Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a natural medium used in cell cultures containing the large amount of nutrients necessary for cell growth and is often used for in vitro cultures of animal cells. Although FBS plays a vital role in cell cultures, there are small molecules contained within FBS that remain unidentified, and their effects on cultured cells is poorly understood. Here, we report that different brands of FBS have varying influences on the background expression of IL-8, not TNFα and IL1β in epithelial cells. The endogenous small molecules in FBS and ERK pathways may contribute to these effects. In addition, FBS form the IL-8 stimulation and IL-8 non-responsive groups have different metabolome profiles. Overall, our study suggests that metabolites in FBS should be included in the quantitative considerations when conducting cell experiments, especially immune-related experiments, to improve the repeatability of experimental results in scientific papers; IL-8 could thus be an important factor in selecting FBS.}

               keratocytes (CSK) are crucial for cellular research and corneal

               transforms into stromal fibroblasts (SF) and scar inducing
               myofibroblasts (Myo-SF). Current protocols mainly rely on
               xenogeneic fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human platelet lysate (hPL)
               could be a viable, potentially autologous, alternative. We found
               high cell survival with both supplements in CSK and SF. Cell
               numbers and Ki67+ ratios increased with higher fractions of hPL
               and FBS in CSK and SF. We detected a loss in CSK marker
               expression (Col8A2, ALDH3A1 and LUM) with increasing fractions
               of FBS and hPL in CSK and SF. The expression of the Myo-SF
               marker SMA increased with higher amounts of FBS but decreased
               with incremental hPL substitution in both cell types, implying
               an antifibrotic effect of hPL. Immunohistochemistry confirmed
               the RT-PCR findings. bFGF and HGF were only found in hPL and
               could be responsible for suppressing the Myo-SF conversion.
               Considering all findings, we propose 0.5\% hPL as a suitable
               substitution in CSK culture, as this xeno-free component
               efficiently preserved CSK characteristics, with non-inferiority
               in terms of cell viability, cell number and proliferation in
               comparison to the established 0.5\% FBS protocol.",

abstract = {Fetal bovine serum (FBS) is a common supplement to in vitro culture media. A workshop was organized to discuss whether or not fetuses might suffer when blood is withdrawn, and to discuss serum replacement methods. When bovine fetuses are exposed after slaughter of the dam, they can suffer only if they inflate their lungs with air and increase their blood oxygen to levels compatible with awareness. Preventing fetuses from breathing air or killing them by an efficient method, according to clearly defined safeguards, ensures that fetal blood collection is humane. Since serum is a supplement of unknown composition, which could be contaminated with unwanted factors, there are scientific and safety reasons for omitting FBS from culture media. Several media have been developed in which minimal or no animal derived components are present. Also, different cell types have been adapted to serum-free media. As yet, no standard serum free media are present, and each cell type requires its own medium composition. Among other recommendations, the establishment of a public database with information on cell types and their serum-free medium composition is proposed.}

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Professional identity is who we are in the context
               of our chosen profession, a complex and dynamic process. The
               purpose of this study was to describe pharmacy students'
               understanding of the terms professionalism and professional
               identity and the elements of formal and informal curricular
               activities that may contribute to professional identity
               formation. METHODS: This anonymous cross-sectional survey was
               administered to pharmacy students in years one through five at
               all 10 Canadian pharmacy schools with the help of local Canadian
               Association of Pharmacy Students and Interns representatives.
               Students were first asked to define professionalism and
               professional identity and then were provided with a definition
               of professional identity to support their statements as to what
               experiences were meaningful in its development. Both an
               inductive and deductive approach were used for thematic analysis
               of written responses alongside descriptive statistics. RESULTS:
               A total of 172 students responded. Most students were from the
               University of Alberta and were evenly distributed through years
               one through four of pharmacy. Key themes emerged of the
               traditional view of professionalism, expanding the six tenets
               defined by the American College of Clinical Pharmacy to include
               responsibility and accountability. Pharmacy students'
               definitions of professional identity more often included facets
               of professionalism, but when prompted acknowledged teaching
               related opportunities, professional development, and
               role-modelling as playing a key role in professional identity
               development. CONCLUSIONS: Most pharmacy students were unable to
               formally define professional identity; however when prompted
               they did understand what it was and which experiences nurtured
               its development.",
