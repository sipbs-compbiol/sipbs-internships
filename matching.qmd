This page describes the process we use for matching students with SIPBS supervisors and projects for summer internships, what happens after matching, and when.

::: callout-important
**Even though we offer a matching scheme for summer internships and placements, you are at all times at liberty to pursue internships independently. There is no obligation to use the matching scheme, and whether or not you are selected through this scheme, you are of course able to apply for any internships that are available through other routes.**

## Introductory Lecture

As part of the {{< var myplace.course >}} module ([MyPlace link](%7B%7B%3C%20var%20myplace.link%20%3E%7D%7D)) we introduce the SIPBS internship matching process at an in-person session.

::: callout-note
In {{< var ay >}} the introductory session will take place on {{< var session.date >}}**, in** {{< var session.location >}}.

## Project List and Application Form

Early in the academic year, scientists in SIPBS are asked if they would like to offer projects or placements in their groups for summer in the following year. These projects are collated on the [Current Projects](%7B%7B%3C%20var%20projects.current%20%3E%7D%7D) page.

After the introductory session, you will be invited to select up to three PIs, projects, or topics from this [Current Projects](%7B%7B%3C%20var%20projects.current%20%3E%7D%7D) list and to complete an Application Form for matching. This form will be made available after the session.

::: callout-warning
In {{< var ay >}} the deadline for submitting the application form will be {{< var form.deadline >}}.

Forms should be emailed to [{{< var form.email >}}](mailto:%7B%7B%3C%20var%20form.email%20%3E%7D%7D)

## Student Matching and Project Allocation

We operate a ranking process for applications. Applicants are ranked in order by second-year credit-weighted average (%CMA). The highest-ranked students, usually about 8-10, are allocated to projects and supervisors on the basis of student preference.

::: callout-note
Other criteria are applied for third-year direct entrants. A number of places are reserved to accommodate these students.
:::

::: callout-warning
Applicants may be excluded from consideration on the basis of January examination results (e.g. a failing mark).
:::

In {{< var ay >}}, we expect matching of students to supervisors and projects to be complete by {{< var matching.date >}}.

## Student-Supervisor Meeting

In order to be in time for [internship and placement funding opportunity](./external_funding.qmd) deadlines, we ask students and supervisors to meet early in the new year to discuss the project and plan out how to seek funding. In AY2023-24, we expect these meetings to take place in {{< var meeting.date >}}.

::: callout-important
Arranging this meeting is the responsibility of the student and the supervisor. Successful applicants should be sure to contact their supervisor as early as practicable.
:::

## Funding Applications

There are several [opportunities available for internship funding](./external_funding.qmd), and their deadlines for application typically fall in Semester 2. Please be sure to check the details of individual funding schemes for deadlines and any other requirements.

::: callout-important
Funding applications are the responsibility of the student and the supervisor.
:::

## Project Start Dates

Summer placement projects typically begin after the Formal Assessment Period (i.e. Summer Exams), but timing is flexible and to be agreed between supervisor and student.

::: callout-important
Funding timings should be agreed between the student and the supervisor.
