Welcome to the SIPBS Summer Internships and Internship Matching pages for the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences!

These pages should be read in conjunction with the official SIPBS Internship Materials available on the course [MyPlace page]({{< var myplace.link >}})

::: {.callout-tip}
## The matching process for 2024-2025 will begin in October 2024

If you are not matched in this process, please use these pages as a resource to help you with approaching potential supervisors, and to obtain funding and other support.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
You do not need to go through the matching scheme to find or undertake an internship. The university has pages offering advice for arranging your own internship:

- [Work experience and internship placements](https://www.strath.ac.uk/professionalservices/careers/students/workexperience/internshipsplacements/)
- [Making speculative applications for internships](https://www.strath.ac.uk/professionalservices/careers/students/makingapplications/makingspeculativeapplications/)
:::

## What is this site for?

These pages describe the SIPBS summer internship matching process and provide supporting information about this activity, including a list of potential internship opportunities

## Getting started

We suggest that you start by looking over the description of the [Matching](matching.qmd) process, [Current Projects](%7B%7B%3C%20var%20projects.current%20%3E%7D%7D) and [External Funding](external_funding.qmd) under **General Information**. After that, please take a look at the [Slides](slides.qmd) and complete the [form](forms.qmd) if you wish to be considered for the matching process.
