Welcome to the SIPBS Summer Internships and Internship Matching pages for the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences!

## What is this site for?

These pages describe the SIPBS summer internship matching process and provide supporting information about this activity, including a list of potential internship opportunities

## Getting started

We suggest that you start by looking over the description of the [Matching](matching.qmd) process, [Current Projects](%7B%7B%3C%20var%20projects.current%20%3E%7D%7D) and [External Funding](external_funding.md) under **General Information**.
